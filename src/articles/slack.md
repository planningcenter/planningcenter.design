Slack is for day-to-day conversation and team/topical discussion.

Join or ignore any channels you like.  
But you're expected to be in any of the `#general-` prefixed channels.  
The expection is `#general-carlsbad`.  
If you work remotely, join `#remote` (which isn't general prefixed).  

Mandetory channels are like this spelling rule:

> *i* before *e* except after *c* or when sounded as *ay* as in *neighbor* and *weigh* or words like *weird*, *height*, *foreign*, *caffeiene*, *conterfeight*...

## Mandetory
* `#general` — Company news 📰
* `#general-announcement` — Legal/policy/personal company news 👩‍⚖️
* `#general-carlsbad` on `#remote` — Location-specific details 🌎

## Design
* `#design` — Open design discussions 👩‍🎨
* `🔒dreamland` — Secret design discussions 🦄

## Other
* `#watercooler` — Nonsense and frivolity.
* `#health` — A twice daily reminder to move. Also a reminder that everyone in Carlsbad is `afk`.
* `#retirement` — We like talking about retirement prep and tax coordination.
